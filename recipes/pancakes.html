<p>This is my recipe for Kodiak pancakes. Its a simple one which I frequent weekend mornings.
    The Kodiak mix is my favorite due to the added protein. If you follow my recipe you'll
    have tasty pancakes which aren't too dry and will leave you feeling full.
</p>
<p>My recipe makes about 6 decently sized pancakes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups Kodiak pancake mix</li>

      <li>Heat your stove to low or medium low heat, you don't ever want high heat for pancakes</li>
      <li>When your pan is warm, add butter and spread it all on the surface</li>
