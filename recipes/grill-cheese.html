  <h1>Grill Cheese</h1>

  <p>The following recipe is my take on the original grill cheese. This is a sample snack that you and your family will love.
    Best of all it specifically done within your air-fryer to limit the pots that need to be washed.</p>
   <p>So no need to start your stove, just plug in your high tech air-fryer and follow along.</p>
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pepperidge farm italian white bread</li>
    <li>Butter, slightly melted for easy spreading</li>
    <li>Yellow cheese, I get Old World Red Hoop Cheddar cheese(from Costco)</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Take 1/4 butter and place it on a microwavable bowl. You may need more depending on how many sandwiches your making</li>
    <li>Warm it up for about 7 seconds. You don't want it be water liquified just melted enough where you can easily spread it</li>
    <li>Spread butter on both sides of each bread slice</li>

    <li>Chop your cheese into slices, don't make them to thin because you want to taste the cheese of course</li>
    <li>Make sure the cheese covers the whole slice</li>
    <li>Bring together the other bread slice and place on the air-fryer</li>
    <p><em>Make sure you use a liner for your air-fryer so that it can be an easier clean up later</em></p>
    <li>Set air-fryer for 390</li>
    <li>Cook for 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes when you flip</li>
    <li>Remove from air-fryer and cut diagonally only</li>

  </ol>
  <p>You'll see that they are done once the bread has that nice brown color and the cheese is oozing a bit.</p>
  <h4>Side note</h4>
  <p>You can add a slice or two of your favorite ham in between the cheese to change it up a bit.
  This adds a bit of protein to the meal. If you get the Pepperidge farm bread
    it will also increase the amount of protein. </p>
